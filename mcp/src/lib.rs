//! BitRouter origin MCP server — exposes BitRouter's own tools
//! (`complete` / `list_models` / `status`) over stdio and streamable HTTP.
//!
//! Distinct from the MCP *gateway* in `bitrouter-sdk::mcp`, which proxies
//! *upstream* MCP servers. This crate is the *origin* server for BitRouter's
//! own capabilities.
